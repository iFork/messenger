1. INTRODUCTION

This is the README file for Instigate Build System project which provides set
of makefiles and scripts to compile, test, generate documentations and create
installation packages for SW/HW projects. Supports multiple languages, GUI
toolkits, and platforms. 

The library should be extended to support also compilation / simulation for
Verilog, VHDL.

2. FILE MANIFEST

src/               : The source codes of the test projects.

mkf/               : GNU make scripts which are used for building/running the
                     project.

makefile           : provides the targets which are described in "USAGE"
                     section.

3. INSTALLATION

The project will be installed by execution of the "make install" command.
By default the project will be installed with the following path:
        - $(HOME)/instigate-mkf
There is need to change the 'prefix' parameter value in top-level makefile
to be able to change the default path for installation. 
        prefix := $(HOME)

4. USAGE 

At first the build type and link type should be setup.
        make setup [build_type=<build_type>] [link_type=<link_type>] 
			[use_gcov=<yes|no>] [use_sdk=<yes|no>] [sdk_path=<path>]
			[office_sdk_path=<path>]

where build_type is:

        debug - switches off compiler optimizations and enable debug
                information generation. The default value is debug.

        release - switches on compiler optimizations and disable debug
                  information generation.

      link_type is:

        dynamic - builds dynamic libraries (shared objects *.so). The default
                  value is dynamic.

        static - builds static libraries (archives *.a) 

      use_sdk is:

        yes - use third party tools from the <sdk_path> and <office_sdk_path>.
	      The default value for <sdk_path> is
	      /opt/instigate/gnu_linux_sdk/2.2.
	      The default value for <office_sdk_path> is
	      /opt/instigate/gnu_linux_office/1.3.

        no - ignore <sdk_path> and <office_sdk_path> variables

      sdk_path is:

        The path of third party tools.

      office_sdk_path is:

        The path of installed office package

      use_gcov is:

        yes - compile with gcov flags

usage: make [<target>]

          where <target> = help | clean | clean_conf |
                        developer_docs | user_docs | docs | clean_docs |
                        test | clean_test |
                        coverage | clean_coverage |
                        continuous_tests | weekly_tests | nightly_tests
           
         default - build the project according to current setup
 
            help - displays information about make usage
           
           clean - cleans all the temporary files created by previous builds

      clean_conf - cleans statically stored meta-information
                   about dependency libraries generated during first build
 
  developer_docs - generates documentation of the project for developer
 
       user_docs - generates user's documentation
 
            docs - generates both the developer's and user's documentation 
 
      clean_docs - cleans the documentation generated by Doxygen tool

regression_tests - includes the tests to check the basic principles of the
                   application.  Should be called after each modification to
                   check the regression of application.
                  
continuous_tests - tests to be run after each modification. 
                  
   nightly_tests - tests to be run after working day
                     
    weekly_tests - tests to be run after working week 

           test - runs the tests of the project, by default continuous tests are
                  run
           
     clean_test - removes the temporary files generated by 'make test'
                  command

       coverage - collect coverage data for the mentioned projects. The list of
                  the sub-projects for which the coverage data 
                  should be collected, can be defined by 'coverage_projects' 
                  variable in the top level makefile.

 clean_coverage - removes the temporary files generated by 'make coverage'
                  command
